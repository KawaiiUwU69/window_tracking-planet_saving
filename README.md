# window_tracking-planet_saving
ðŸ’™ Working out optimal window ventilation for heat saving and in-room carbon dioxide reduction. 

ðŸ’› Will shout at you to close the window in time, so you save the heat => save the planet resources.

We have analyzed the CO2 data to see how the general ventilation frequently and duration can be adjusted. This is for the app to fit our building better. Data analysis can be found in *graph ppm vs time.pptx*.

For the demonstration purposes, however, we've set the timer to be short (30 seconds).

*generic case: no CO2 sensors*
- research recommended window opening times;
- research recommended window opening freq.;

*uni recome.: with CO2 sensors*
= use the CO2 data as a guide - not the time;


- their
